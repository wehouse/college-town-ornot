## What is the problem we are solving here?
- **Context** As real life investors of real estate property, how to invest our money effectively is at the top of our minds.


---

## Analysis and Preliminary Conclusion
- **Scenario** We did some preliminary analysis and discovered something interesting, a few properties we checked in Berkeley, CA
did not lose value as much during the recession as properties in neighborhoods away from it. On further examination we checked a few other locations like 
Princeton, NJ and came to realize that this may have to do with University Towns. We concluded that if this 
relationship holds, we may have found the secret of recession proof real estate investing.

## What is the Hypothesis and Methodology?
- **Hypothesis** University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. 
- **Method** Run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom.
